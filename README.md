# Web MIDI API Spec

This repository contains the latest editor's draft of the [W3C AudioWG](http://www.w3.org/2011/audio/)'s Web MIDI API.

You can preview the current version of the master branch [here](http://webaudio.github.com/web-midi-api/).

# Tests

For normative changes, a corresponding
[web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) PR is highly appreciated. Typically,
both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should
not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why
and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/new) to follow
up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.
