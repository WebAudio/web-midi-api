        Some user agents have music devices, such as synthesizers,
        keyboard and other controllers, and drum machines connected to their host computer or device.  The widely adopted
        Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) protocol enables
        electronic musical instruments, controllers and computers to
        communicate and synchronize with each other. MIDI does not transmit
        audio signals: instead, it sends event messages about musical notes,
        controller signals for parameters such as volume, vibrato and panning,
        cues and clock signals to set the tempo, and system-specific MIDI
        communications (e.g. to remotely store synthesizer-specific patch
        data).  This same protocol has become a standard for non-musical uses,
        such as show control, lighting and special effects control.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification defines an API supporting the MIDI protocol, enabling web applications to enumerate and select MIDI input and output devices on the client system and send and receive MIDI messages. It is intended to enable non-music MIDI applications as well as music ones, by providing low-level access to the MIDI devices available on the users' systems.  The Web MIDI API is not intended to describe music or controller inputs semantically; it is designed to expose the mechanics of MIDI input and output interfaces, and the practical aspects of sending and receiving MIDI messages, without identifying what those actions might mean semantically (e.g., in terms of "modulate the vibrato by 20Hz" or "play a G#7 chord", other than in terms of changing a controller value or sending a set of note-on messages that happen to represent a G#7 chord).
      </p>
      <p data-format="markdown">
        To some users, "MIDI" has become synonymous with Standard MIDI Files and General MIDI.  That is not the intent of this API; the use case of simply playing back a .SMF file is not within the purview of this specification (it could be considered a different format to be supported by the HTML `<audio>` element, for example).  The Web MIDI API is intended to enable direct access to devices that respond to MIDI - controllers, external synthesizers or lighting systems, for example.  The Web MIDI API is also explicitly designed to enable a new class of applications on the web that can respond to MIDI controller inputs - using external hardware controllers with physical buttons, knobs and sliders (as well as musical controllers like keyboard, guitar or wind instrument controllers) to control web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Web MIDI API is also expected to be used in conjunction with other APIs and elements of the web platform, notably the Web Audio API.  This API is also intended to be familiar to users of MIDI APIs on other systems, such as Apple's CoreMIDI and Microsoft's Windows MIDI API.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Web MIDI API specification defines a means for web developers to
        enumerate, manipulate and access MIDI devices - for example, interfaces that may provide hardware MIDI ports with other devices plugged in to them and USB devices that support the USB-MIDI specification. Having a Web API for MIDI enables web applications that use existing software and
        hardware synthesizers, hardware music controllers and light systems and other mechanical
        apparatus controlled by MIDI.  This API has been defined with this wide variety of use cases in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The approaches taken by this API are similar to those taken in Apple's CoreMIDI API and Microsoft's Windows MIDI API; that is, the API is designed to represent the low-level software protocol of MIDI, in order to enable developers to build powerful MIDI software on top.  The API enables the developer to enumerate input and output interfaces, and send and receive MIDI messages, but (similar to the aforementioned APIs) it does not attempt to semantically define or interpret MIDI messages beyond what is necessary to robustly support current devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Web MIDI API is not intended to directly implement high-level concepts such as sequencing; it does not directly support Standard MIDI Files, for example, although a Standard MIDI File player can be built on top of the Web MIDI API.  It is also not intended to semantically capture patches or controller assignments, as General MIDI does; such interpretation is outside the scope of the Web MIDI API (though again, General MIDI can easily be utilized through the Web MIDI API).

                When invoked, returns a Promise object representing a request for access to MIDI devices on the user's system.
              </p>

              <p>
                Requesting MIDI access SHOULD prompt the user for access to MIDI devices,
                particularly if system exclusive access is requested.  In some
                scenarios, this permission may have already been implicitly or
                explicitly granted, in which case this prompt may not appear.
                If the user gives express permission or the call is otherwise
                approved, the vended Promise is resolved.  The
                underlying system may choose to allow the user to select
                specific MIDI interfaces to expose to this API (i.e. pick
                and choose interfaces on an individual basis), although
                this is not required.  The system may also choose to prompt
                (or not) based on whether system exclusive support is
                requested, as system exclusive access has greater privacy and
                security implications.</p>
              <p>If the user declines or the call is denied for any other reason, the Promise is rejected with a {{DOMException}} parameter.

            cache these ids locally to re-create a MIDI setup.
            Some systems may not support completely unique persistent
            identifiers; in such cases, it will be more challenging to
            maintain identifiers when another interface is added or removed
            from the system.  (This might throw off the index of the
            requested port.)  It is expected that the system will do the
            best it can to match a port across instances of the MIDI API:
            for example, an implementation may opaquely use some form of
            hash of the port interface manufacturer, name and
            index as the id, so that a reference to that port id is likely
            to match the port when plugged in. Applications may use the
            comparison of id of MIDIPorts to test for equality.</p>

        (for example, when a MIDI device is first plugged in to the computer),

      <p>The following are some examples of common MIDI usage in JavaScript.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Getting Access to the MIDI System</h3>
        <p>This example shows how to request access to the MIDI system.</p>
          <pre class="example">var midi = null;  // global MIDIAccess object

function onMIDISuccess( midiAccess ) {
  console.log( "MIDI ready!" );
  midi = midiAccess;  // store in the global (in real usage, would probably keep in an object instance)
}

function onMIDIFailure(msg) {
  console.log( "Failed to get MIDI access - " + msg );
}

navigator.requestMIDIAccess().then( onMIDISuccess, onMIDIFailure );</pre>

      <section>
        <h3>Requesting Access to the MIDI System with System Exclusive Support</h3>
        <p>This example shows how to request access to the MIDI system, including the ability to send and receive system exclusive messages.</p>
          <pre class="example">var midi = null;  // global MIDIAccess object

function onMIDISuccess( midiAccess ) {
  console.log( "MIDI ready!" );
  midi = midiAccess;  // store in the global (in real usage, would probably keep in an object instance)
}

function onMIDIFailure(msg) {
  console.log( "Failed to get MIDI access - " + msg );
}

navigator.requestMIDIAccess( { sysex: true } ).then( onMIDISuccess, onMIDIFailure );</pre>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Listing Inputs and Outputs</h3>
        <p>This example gets the list of the input and output ports and prints their information to the console log, using ES6 for...of notation.
          <pre class="example">function listInputsAndOutputs( midiAccess ) {
  for (var entry of midiAccess.inputs) {
    var input = entry[1];
    console.log( "Input port [type:'" + input.type + "'] id:'" + input.id +

      <section>
        <h3>Sending MIDI Messages to an Output Device</h3>
        <p>This example sends a middle C note on message immediately on MIDI channel 1 (MIDI channels are 0-indexed, but generally referred to as channels 1-16), and queues a corresponding note off message for 1 second later.</p>
        <pre class="example">function sendMiddleC( midiAccess, portID ) {
  var noteOnMessage = [0x90, 60, 0x7f];    // note on, middle C, full velocity
  var output = midiAccess.outputs.get(portID);
  output.send( noteOnMessage );  //omitting the timestamp means send immediately.
  output.send( [0x80, 60, 0x40], window.performance.now() + 1000.0 ); // Inlined array creation- note off, middle C,
                                                                      // release velocity = 64, timestamp = now + 1000ms.
}</pre>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>A Simple Loopback</h3>
        <p>This example loops all input messages on the first input port to the first output port - including system exclusive messages.</p>
        <pre class="example">var midi = null;  // global MIDIAccess object
var output = null;

function echoMIDIMessage( event ) {
  if (output) {
    output.send( event.data, event.timestamp );
  }
}

  if (input)
    input.onmidimessage = echoMIDIMessage;
  output = midiAccess.outputs.values().next().value;
  if (!input || !output)
    console.log("Uh oh! Couldn't get i/o ports.");
}

function onMIDIFailure(msg) {
  console.log( "Failed to get MIDI access - " + msg );
}

navigator.requestMIDIAccess().then( onMIDISuccess, onMIDIFailure );</pre>

        <h3>A Simple Monophonic Sine Wave MIDI Synthesizer</h3>

      <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations of MIDI</h2>
      <p>
        There are two primary security and privacy concerns with adding the Web MIDI API to the web platform:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Allowing the enumeration of the user's MIDI interfaces is a potential target for fingerprinting (that is, uniquely identifying a user by the specific MIDI interfaces they have connected).  Note that in this context, what can be enumerated is the MIDI <i>interfaces</i> - not, for example, an individual sampler or synthesizer plugged into a MIDI interface, as these would not be enumerated, unless those devices are connected to the host computer with USB (USB-MIDI devices typically have their own MIDI interface, and would be enumerated).  The interfaces that could be fingerprinted are equivalent to MIDI "ports", and for each device the API will expose the name of the device, manufacturer, and opaque identifier of the MIDI interface (but not any attached devices).
          <p>Few systems will have significant numbers of MIDI devices attached; those systems that do will typically use hardware MIDI interfaces, not fanning out a dozen USB-MIDI connections through USB hubs.  In this case, of course, enumerating the MIDI “devices” will only see the hardware MIDI interface(s), not the synthesizers, samplers, etc. plugged into it on the other side.  Given the few number of devices plugged in, the amount of information exposed here is fairly symmetric with the fingerprinting concern exposed by other APIs such as the Gamepad API.  The vast majority of systems have relatively few MIDI interfaces attached.</li>
        <li>Separate from the fingerprinting concerns of identifying the available ports are concerns around sending and receiving MIDI messages.  Those issues are explored in more depth below.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In brief, the general categories of things you can do with MIDI ports are:
        <ol>
          <li>Sending short messages (all messages except SysEx)
          <li>Receiving short messages (all messages except SysEx)
          <li>Sending SysEx messages.  SysEx messages include both commonly recognized MIDI Time Code and MIDI Sample Dump Standard, as well as device-specific messages (like “patch control data for a Roland Jupiter-80 synthesizer”) that do not apply to other devices.
          <li>Receiving SysEx messages.
        </ol>
      <p>The impact of each of these is:
        <ol>
          <li>Sending short messages: sending note-on/note-off/controller messages would let you cause sounds to be played by attached devices, including (on Mac and Windows) any default virtual synthesizers. This by itself does not cause any concerning exposure - you can already make sounds without interaction, through &lt;audio&gt;, Flash, or Web Audio.  Some attached devices might be professional lighting control systems, so it’s possible you could control stage lighting; however, this is extremely rare, and no known system has the ability to cause lasting damage or information leakage based solely on short messages; at worst, a malicious page could flash lights, and the user could close the page and reset their lighting controller.
          <li>Receiving short messages: receiving note-on/note-off/controller messages would not cause any information exposure or security issues, as there is no identifying data being received, just a stream of controller messages - all of which must be initiated by the user on that MIDI device (except clock-type messages).  This is very analogous to receiving keyboard or mouse events.
          <li>Sending and Receiving SysEx.  This is the biggest concern, because it would be possible to write code that looked for system-specific responses to sysex messages, which could identify the hardware available, and then use it to download data - e.g. samples stored in a sampler - or replace that data (erasing sample data or patches in the device), although both these scenarios would have to be coded for a particular device.  It is also possible that some samplers might enable a system exclusive message to start recording a sample - so if the sampler happened to have a dedicated microphone attached (uncommon in practice, but possible), it would be possible to write code specific to a particular device that could record a short sample of sound and then upload it to the network without further user intervention.  (You could not stream audio from the device, and most samplers have fairly limited memory, and MIDI Sample Dump sysex is a slow way to transfer data - it has to transcode into 7-bit - so it’s unlikely you could listen in for long periods.)  More explicit fingerprinting is a concern, as the patch information/stored samples/user configuration could uniquely identify the system (although again, this requires much device-specific code; there is not standardized “grab all patches and hash it” capability.)  This does suggest that system exclusive messages are in a security category of their own.
        </ol>
      <p>It's also useful to examine what scenarios are enabled by MIDI, mapped against these features:
        <ol>
          <li>Receiving short messages.  This is the most attractive scenario for Web MIDI, as it enables getting input from keyboards, drum pads, guitars, wind controllers, DJ/controllerist controllers, and more, and use those messages as input to control instruments and features in the Web Audio API as well as other control scenarios (MIDI is the protocol of choice for the multi-billion-dollar music production industry for getting physical controllers like knobs and buttons attached to your computer, both in pro/prosumer audio and media applications as well as consumer applications like Garageband.)
          <li>Sending short messages - it’s tempting to say sending is significantly less interesting, as the scenario of attached output devices like hardware synthesizers is less common in today's market.  The major exception to this is that many of the MIDI controllers have external host control of their indicator lights, and this makes them dramatically more useful.  For example, the very popular Novation Launchpad controller uses MIDI note on/off messages sent to it to turn on/off and change colors of the buttons.  The same is true of nearly all DJ controllers.
          <li>Sending and receiving SysEx - obviously, for more advanced communication with high-end hardware devices, SysEx is required.  Unfortunately, some common MIDI commands are also sent as system exclusive messages (MIDI Machine Control, for example - generic start/stop/rew/ffw commands) - and many devices use system exclusive to program patches, send advanced controller messages, download firmware, etc., which are much-demanded scenarios for Web MIDI.  Some devices use sysex as a direct control protocol, as they can pack more data into a single “message”, and most devices use SysEx as way to save and restore patches and configuration information on less-expensive computer storage.  Several of the major music hardware producers have expressed strong interest in using Web MIDI to provide web-based configuration and programming interfaces to their hardware.  In short, disabling sysex altogether does not only disable high-end scenarios.
        </ol>
      <p>In short: the additional fingerprinting exposure of enumerating MIDI devices is directly analogous to the Gamepad API’s additional fingerprinting exposure through gamepad enumeration; typical users will only have at most a few devices connected, their configuration may change, and the information exposed is about the interface itself (i.e., no user-configured data).
      <p>The additional security concern for receiving short messages is also small - it’s analogous to listening to keyboard, mouse, mobile/laptop accelerometer, touch input or gamepad events; there is no additional information exposed, and all messages other than clock signals must be initiated by the user.
      <p>The additional concerns about sending short messages are analogous to any audio output - you cannot overwrite user information or expose use information, but you can make sounds happen, change patches, or (in rare configurations) toggle lights - but non-destructively, and not persistently.
      <p>System Exclusive, on the other hand, has a much less bounded potential, and it seems that distinguishing requests for SysEx separately in the API is a good idea, in order to more carefully provide user security hooks. The <a data-lt="navigator.requestMIDIAccess">suggested security model</a> explicitly allows user agents to require the user's approval before giving access to MIDI devices, although it is not currently required to prompt the user for this approval - but it also detailed that system exclusive support must be requested as part of that request.
