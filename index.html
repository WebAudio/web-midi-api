        Some user agents have music devices, such as synthesizers, keyboard and
        other controllers, and drum machines connected to their host computer
        or device. The widely adopted Musical Instrument Digital Interface
        (MIDI) protocol enables electronic musical instruments, controllers and
        computers to communicate and synchronize with each other. MIDI does not
        transmit audio signals: instead, it sends event messages about musical
        notes, controller signals for parameters such as volume, vibrato and
        panning, cues and clock signals to set the tempo, and system-specific
        MIDI communications (e.g. to remotely store synthesizer-specific patch
        data). This same protocol has become a standard for non-musical uses,
        such as show control, lighting and special effects control.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification defines an API supporting the MIDI protocol,
        enabling web applications to enumerate and select MIDI input and output
        devices on the client system and send and receive MIDI messages. It is
        intended to enable non-music MIDI applications as well as music ones,
        by providing low-level access to the MIDI devices available on the
        users' systems. The Web MIDI API is not intended to describe music or
        controller inputs semantically; it is designed to expose the mechanics
        of MIDI input and output interfaces, and the practical aspects of
        sending and receiving MIDI messages, without identifying what those
        actions might mean semantically (e.g., in terms of "modulate the
        vibrato by 20Hz" or "play a G#7 chord", other than in terms of changing
        a controller value or sending a set of note-on messages that happen to
        represent a G#7 chord).
      </p>
      <p data-format="markdown">
        To some users, "MIDI" has become synonymous with Standard MIDI Files
        and General MIDI. That is not the intent of this API; the use case of
        simply playing back a .SMF file is not within the purview of this
        specification (it could be considered a different format to be
        supported by the HTML [^audio^] element, for example). The Web MIDI API
        is intended to enable direct access to devices that respond to MIDI -
        controllers, external synthesizers or lighting systems, for example.
        The Web MIDI API is also explicitly designed to enable a new class of
        applications on the web that can respond to MIDI controller inputs -
        using external hardware controllers with physical buttons, knobs and
        sliders (as well as musical controllers like keyboard, guitar or wind
        instrument controllers) to control web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Web MIDI API is also expected to be used in conjunction with other
        APIs and elements of the web platform, notably the Web Audio API. This
        API is also intended to be familiar to users of MIDI APIs on other
        systems, such as Apple's CoreMIDI and Microsoft's Windows MIDI API.

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Web MIDI API specification defines a means for web developers to
        enumerate, manipulate and access MIDI devices - for example, interfaces
        that may provide hardware MIDI ports with other devices plugged in to
        them and USB devices that support the USB-MIDI specification. Having a
        Web API for MIDI enables web applications that use existing software
        and hardware synthesizers, hardware music controllers and light systems
        and other mechanical apparatus controlled by MIDI. This API has been
        defined with this wide variety of use cases in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The approaches taken by this API are similar to those taken in Apple's
        CoreMIDI API and Microsoft's Windows MIDI API; that is, the API is
        designed to represent the low-level software protocol of MIDI, in order
        to enable developers to build powerful MIDI software on top. The API
        enables the developer to enumerate input and output interfaces, and
        send and receive MIDI messages, but (similar to the aforementioned
        APIs) it does not attempt to semantically define or interpret MIDI
        messages beyond what is necessary to robustly support current devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Web MIDI API is not intended to directly implement high-level
        concepts such as sequencing; it does not directly support Standard MIDI
        Files, for example, although a Standard MIDI File player can be built
        on top of the Web MIDI API. It is also not intended to semantically
        capture patches or controller assignments, as General MIDI does; such
        interpretation is outside the scope of the Web MIDI API (though again,
        General MIDI can easily be utilized through the Web MIDI API).

      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in

            </p>
            <p>
              Requesting MIDI access SHOULD prompt the user for access to MIDI
              devices, particularly if <a>System Exclusive</a> access is
              requested. In some scenarios, this permission may have already
              been implicitly or explicitly granted, in which case this prompt
              may not appear.  If the user gives express permission or the call
              is otherwise approved, the vended Promise is resolved. The
              underlying system may choose to allow the user to select specific
              MIDI interfaces to expose to this API (i.e. pick and choose
              interfaces on an individual basis), although this is not
              required. The system may also choose to prompt (or not) based on
              whether <a>System Exclusive</a> support is requested, as <a>System
              Exclusive</a> access has greater privacy and security
              implications.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the user declines or the call is denied for any other reason,
              the Promise is rejected with a {{DOMException}} parameter.

              A unique ID of the port. This can be used by developers to
              remember ports the user has chosen for their application. The
              User Agent MUST ensure that the {{MIDIPort/id}} is unique to only
              that port. The User Agent SHOULD ensure that the id is maintained
              across instances of the application - e.g., when the system is
              rebooted - and when a device is removed from the system.
              Applications may want to cache these ids locally to re-create a
              MIDI setup. Some systems may not support completely unique
              persistent identifiers; in such cases, it will be more
              challenging to maintain identifiers when another interface is
              added or removed from the system. (This might throw off the index
              of the requested port.) It is expected that the system will do
              the best it can to match a port across instances of the MIDI API:
              for example, an implementation may opaquely use some form of hash
              of the port interface manufacturer, name and index as the id, so
              that a reference to that port id is likely to match the port when
              plugged in. Applications may use the comparison of id of
              MIDIPorts to test for equality.

              support shared access to MIDI devices, so using explicit open()
              and close() calls will enable MIDI applications to predictably
              control this exclusive access to devices.

              The underlying implementation may not need to do anything in
              response to this call. However, some underlying implementations
              may not be able to support shared access to MIDI devices, and the
              explicit close() call enables MIDI applications to ensure other
              applications can gain access to devices.

              When invoked, this method returns a Promise object representing a
              request for access to the given MIDI port on the user's system.
              When the port has been closed (and therefore, in exclusive access
              systems, the port is available to other applications), the vended
              Promise is resolved. If the port is disconnected, the Promise is
              rejected.

          Privacy Considerations
        </h2>
        <p>
          Allowing the enumeration of the user's MIDI interfaces is a potential
          target for fingerprinting (that is, uniquely identifying a user by the
          specific MIDI interfaces they have connected). Note that in this
          context, what can be enumerated is the MIDI <i>interfaces</i> - not,
          for example, an individual sampler or synthesizer plugged into a MIDI
          interface, as these would not be enumerated, unless those devices are
          connected to the host computer with USB (USB-MIDI devices typically
          have their own MIDI interface, and would be enumerated).  The
          interfaces that could be fingerprinted are equivalent to MIDI "ports",
          and for each device the API will expose the name of the device,
          manufacturer, and opaque identifier of the MIDI interface (but not any
          attached devices).
        </p>
        <p>
          Few systems will have significant numbers of MIDI devices attached;
          those systems that do will typically use hardware MIDI interfaces, not
          fanning out a dozen USB-MIDI connections through USB hubs. In this
          case, of course, enumerating the MIDI “devices” will only see the
          hardware MIDI interface(s), not the synthesizers, samplers,
          etc. plugged into it on the other side.  Given the few number of
          devices plugged in, the amount of information exposed here is fairly
          symmetric with the fingerprinting concern exposed by other APIs such
          as the Gamepad API. The vast majority of systems have relatively few
          MIDI interfaces attached.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short: the additional fingerprinting exposure of enumerating MIDI
          devices is directly analogous to the Gamepad API’s additional
          fingerprinting exposure through gamepad enumeration; typical users
          will only have at most a few devices connected, their configuration
          may change, and the information exposed is about the interface itself
          (i.e., no user-configured data).

          Security Considerations
        </h2>
        <p>
          Separate from the fingerprinting concerns of identifying the available
          ports are concerns around sending and receiving MIDI messages. Those
          issues are explored in more depth below.
        </p>
        <p>
          In brief, the general categories of things you can do with MIDI ports
          are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sending short messages (all messages except SysEx)
          </li>
          <li>Receiving short messages (all messages except SysEx)
          </li>
          <li>Sending SysEx messages. SysEx messages include both commonly
          recognized MIDI Time Code and MIDI Sample Dump Standard, as well as
          device-specific messages (like “patch control data for a Roland
          Jupiter-80 synthesizer”) that do not apply to other devices.
          </li>
          <li>Receiving SysEx messages.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The impact of each of these is:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sending short messages: sending note-on/note-off/controller
          messages would let you cause sounds to be played by attached devices,
          including (on Mac and Windows) any default virtual synthesizers. This
          by itself does not cause any concerning exposure - you can already
          make sounds without interaction, through &lt;audio&gt;, Flash, or Web
          Audio. Some attached devices might be professional lighting control
          systems, so it’s possible you could control stage lighting; however,
          this is extremely rare, and no known system has the ability to cause
          lasting damage or information leakage based solely on short messages;
          at worst, a malicious page could flash lights, and the user could
          close the page and reset their lighting controller.
          </li>
          <li>Receiving short messages: receiving note-on/note-off/controller
          messages would not cause any information exposure or security issues,
          as there is no identifying data being received, just a stream of
          controller messages - all of which must be initiated by the user on
          that MIDI device (except clock-type messages). This is very analogous
          to receiving keyboard or mouse events.
          </li>
          <li>Sending and Receiving SysEx. This is the biggest concern, because
          it would be possible to write code that looked for system-specific
          responses to sysex messages, which could identify the hardware
          available, and then use it to download data - e.g. samples stored in a
          sampler - or replace that data (erasing sample data or patches in the
          device), although both these scenarios would have to be coded for a
          particular device. It is also possible that some samplers might enable
          a <a>System Exclusive</a> message to start recording a sample - so if
          the sampler happened to have a dedicated microphone attached (uncommon
          in practice, but possible), it would be possible to write code
          specific to a particular device that could record a short sample of
          sound and then upload it to the network without further user
          intervention. (You could not stream audio from the device, and most
          samplers have fairly limited memory, and MIDI Sample Dump sysex is a
          slow way to transfer data - it has to transcode into 7-bit - so it’s
          unlikely you could listen in for long periods.) More explicit
          fingerprinting is a concern, as the patch information/stored
          samples/user configuration could uniquely identify the system
          (although again, this requires much device-specific code; there is not
          standardized “grab all patches and hash it” capability.) This does
          suggest that <a>System Exclusive</a> messages are in a security
          category of their own.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          It's also useful to examine what scenarios are enabled by MIDI,
          mapped against these features:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Receiving short messages. This is the most attractive scenario
          for Web MIDI, as it enables getting input from keyboards, drum pads,
          guitars, wind controllers, DJ/controllerist controllers, and more,
          and use those messages as input to control instruments and features
          in the Web Audio API as well as other control scenarios (MIDI is the
          protocol of choice for the multi-billion-dollar music production
          industry for getting physical controllers like knobs and buttons
          attached to your computer, both in pro/prosumer audio and media
          applications as well as consumer applications like Garageband.)
          </li>
          <li>Sending short messages - it’s tempting to say sending is
          significantly less interesting, as the scenario of attached output
          devices like hardware synthesizers is less common in today's market.
          The major exception to this is that many of the MIDI controllers have
          external host control of their indicator lights, and this makes them
          dramatically more useful. For example, the very popular Novation
          Launchpad controller uses MIDI note on/off messages sent to it to
          turn on/off and change colors of the buttons. The same is true of
          nearly all DJ controllers.
          </li>
          <li>Sending and receiving SysEx - obviously, for more advanced
          communication with high-end hardware devices, SysEx is required.
          Unfortunately, some common MIDI commands are also sent as <a>System
          Exclusive</a> messages (MIDI Machine Control, for example - generic
          start/stop/rew/ffw commands) - and many devices use <a>System
          Exclusive</a> to program patches, send advanced controller messages,
          download firmware, etc., which are much-demanded scenarios for Web
          MIDI. Some devices use sysex as a direct control protocol, as they can
          pack more data into a single “message”, and most devices use SysEx as
          way to save and restore patches and configuration information on
          less-expensive computer storage. Several of the major music hardware
          producers have expressed strong interest in using Web MIDI to provide
          web-based configuration and programming interfaces to their hardware.
          In short, disabling sysex altogether does not only disable high-end
          scenarios.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The additional security concern for receiving short messages is also
          small - it’s analogous to listening to keyboard, mouse, mobile/laptop
          accelerometer, touch input or gamepad events; there is no additional
          information exposed, and all messages other than clock signals must
          be initiated by the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          The additional concerns about sending short messages are analogous to
          any audio output - you cannot overwrite user information or expose
          use information, but you can make sounds happen, change patches, or
          (in rare configurations) toggle lights - but non-destructively, and
          not persistently.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a>System Exclusive</a>, on the other hand, has a much less bounded
          potential, and it seems that distinguishing requests for SysEx
          separately in the API is a good idea, in order to more carefully
          provide user security hooks. The <a data-lt=
          "Navigator.requestMIDIAccess">suggested security model</a> explicitly
          allows user agents to require the user's approval before giving access
          to MIDI devices, although it is not currently required to prompt the
          user for this approval - but it also detailed that <a>System
          Exclusive</a> support must be requested as part of that request.
