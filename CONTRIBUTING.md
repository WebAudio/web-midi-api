# How to contribute

This repository containes the current Web MIDI API _standard document_, developed by the Audio Working Group at the W3C. 
There are _multiple implementations_ of the Web MIDI API standard.

Feature requests are welcome, but a quick search in the [opened and closed issues](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-midi-api/issues) 
is welcome to avoid duplicates.

Pull requests are also welcome, but any change to the standard (barring things like typos and the like) will have 
to be discussed in an issue (and possibly during a call, accessible only to W3C Audio Working Group members).
